                                <h3>Fluency therapy or stuttering therapy Clinic in Delhi</h3>

                                <p>A&nbsp;<strong>fluency disorder</strong>, which is often referred to as “stuttering”, is characterized by primary (core) and secondary behaviours. Primary behaviours may include repetitions of sounds, syllables, or whole words; prolongations of single sounds; or blocks of airflow or voicing during speech.</p>
                                <p>Lat's Talk Clinic offers individual, group and intensive group treatment programs for adults and teens with fluency disorder to&nbsp;find ways to improve the fluency of their speech and reduce the impact&nbsp;<em><strong>stammering</strong></em>&nbsp;has on their lives.</p>
                                <!-- <p>. Our intensive treatment program is internationally recognized and is offered in only few clinics around the world. Our treatment approach is more than 40 years of research and experience in the area of stuttering. Since 1975, we have provided therapy for over 4,000 individuals who stutter (ranging from 2-85 years of age) from across India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, South Asian Countries, Africa and Middle East.</p> -->
