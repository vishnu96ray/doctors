                                          <p><strong>Speech</strong> and &nbsp;<strong>language therapists</strong>&nbsp;  provide life-changing treatment, support and care for children and adults who have difficulties with communication, eating, drinking and swallowing. Therapists help those people who have  physical or psychological reasons, hence have problems in speaking and communicating. Therapists use a variety of strategies:</p>
                                          <ul>
                                              <li><strong>Language intervention activities:</strong>&nbsp; The SLP will interact with a child by playing and talking, using pictures, books, objects, or on-going events to stimulate language development. The therapist may model correct vocabulary and grammar, and use repetition exercises to build language skills.</li>
                                              <li><strong>Articulation therapy:</strong>&nbsp; Articulation, or sound production, exercises involve having the therapist model correct sounds and syllables in words and sentences for a child, often during play activities. The level of play is age-appropriate and related to the child’s specific needs. The SLP will show the child how to make certain sounds, such as the “r” sound, and may show how to move the tongue to make specific sounds.</li>
                                              <li><strong>Oral-motor/feeding and swallowing therapy:</strong>&nbsp; The SLP may use a variety of oral exercises — including facial massage and various tongue, lip, and jaw exercises — to strengthen the muscles of the mouth for eating, drinking, and swallowing. The SLP may also introduce different food textures and temperatures to increase a child’s oral awareness during eating and swallowing.</li>

                                          </ul>
