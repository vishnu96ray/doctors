                                <h3>Goal of Speech Therapy</h3>

                                <h6>Risk of missing</h6>


								<p>The goal of speech therapy is to improve skills that will allow your child to communicate more effectively. There are other benefits as well. These can include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Improvement in the ability to understand and express thoughts, ideas and feelings</li>
									<li>Intelligible speech so your child is understood by others</li>
									<li>Increased ability to problem-solve in an independent environment</li>
									<li>Improved swallowing function and safety</li>
									<li>Achievement of school readiness skills</li>
									<li>Development of pre-literacy skills</li>
									<li>Improved vocal quality</li>
                                    <li>Fluent speech</li>
                                    <li>Development of practical social skills</li>
                                    <li>Better quality of life</li>
                                    <li>Greater self-esteem</li>
                                    <li>Increased independence</li>
								</ul>

								<p>The ability to express oneâ€™s self is paramount. Speech therapy may help your child achieve a greater ability to use and understand language, to communicate with others and to express himself or herself to the greatest extent possible.</p>
								<p>Delaying speech therapy for your child runs the risk of missing that all-important window of time between birth and three years of age when the brain is maturing and learning happens rapidly.</p>
